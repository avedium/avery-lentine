    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>
        I was born on November 24th, 2000, at Memorial Hospital in South Bend, IN. My parents are <a href="https://www.cottageat933.com/melissalentine">Melissa Lentine</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/teklentine/">Tek Lentine</a>. 
        My parents were married in 2005 and separated in 2007. My father remarried in 2008 to my stepmother, Tammy Lentine with her three children Rachael, Nathan, and Jacob Vrielynck.
        I was estranged from my father in 2017 after an extended private dispute over custody between my mother and father. 
        Shortly after, I moved to Fort Wayne, IN with my mother and her romantic partner and after a domestic dispute was taken in by my high school sweetheart's family in 2016.
        I moved back in with my mother in 2019 after she regained domestic stability and was estranged following severe emotional abuse in 2020
        when I sought shelter with a <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/kim-coleman-5a830756">generous coworker and friend</a>.
        I gained full emancipation in 2022 when I entered the private rental market, and now live in an apartment in my hometown of South Bend with my belevod pets Charlotte and Jeremy.

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
        While I generally fostered a reclusive personality due to my family estrangement, I did enjoy the occasional tabletop gaming group and found humor with other reclusive classmates in various subjects and preferred an ecclectic style.
        I attended Penn Harris Maddison schools with nominal grades and a special interest in art and literature. I found a passion for computer science in Dr. Nancy Duncan's class at Penn High School where I made the decision to persue a career in software engineering.
        I dropped out of IUSB's computer science and the 21st Century Scholars program in 2019 due to aforementioned domestic instability. I plan on returning to school in the near future.
    </p>
    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>
        I started my technical career after graduating high school in August, 2019 at <a href="https://www.cpdist.com/">C&P Distributing</a> as a computer technician where I consulted local residents regarding their technical issues and repaired Windows 7/10 laptops and desktops.
        I followed similar responsibilities and career opportunities up until 2022 where I found entry into the corporate sector with Saint Joseph High School in South Bend. 
        I currently work with Beacon Medical Group at Memorial Hospital on a contract upgrading workstations from Windows 10 to 11 and transferring user data.
